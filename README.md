# Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a digital space where I showcase my journey as a PolyU Computing Student, an animal lover, and a STEM Teaching Assistant at the Jockey Club. This website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth transition between desktop and mobile devices. It features several key sections: Home, About, Blog, Skill, and Contact, each crafted to give you a glimpse into my professional expertise and personal interests.

### Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: A dynamically adjusting navbar that switches between a full horizontal menu on desktops to a compact hamburger menu on mobile devices.
- **Home Section**: Utilizes the Typed.js library to create engaging, auto-typing text that introduces me in a unique way.
- **About Section**: Organized into sub-sections for Education, Experience, and Latest Projects. Information is displayed interactively, adapting to user selections.
- **Blog Section**: Shares insights into my daily life, with options to "Read more" or "Read less" for each post, enhancing user engagement.
- **Skill Section**: Displays a curated list of technologies I've worked with, using visually appealing icons and a clean layout.
- **Contact Section**: Features a form that allows visitors to send messages directly to my Google Sheet, thanks to Google Apps Script integration.
